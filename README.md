Titles Library is a web version of a Java App titled MyBooks. Since that inception, the use has changed 
to include all types of media...hince the new title. 

Titles Library uses MariaDB for back-end storage and persistence and JPA annotations for storage objects.
Access to the data objects is closely controlled by a DAO functional model. Some of the tables used have 
relational links to other tables through foreign keys. Relation integrity is minimal at this point.

This is a development project under construction and is not intended to be a fully functional library 
application at this point.
